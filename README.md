# üåæ AgroBalance ‚Äì Smart Nutrient Management System

AgroBalance is a smart agricultural web application designed to assist farmers in determining the ideal balance of nutrients required for their crops based on soil conditions. It serves as a decision-support tool that helps optimize fertilizer usage, ensuring healthier crops, sustainable farming practices, and increased yields.

## üöÄ Features

- üìä **Nutrient Prediction**: Accurately predicts required nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) levels based on soil data.
- üß† **Machine Learning Model**: Uses a trained ML model to analyze soil parameters and recommend NPK values.
- üí¨ **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, intuitive UI for easy interaction by farmers and agronomists.
- üå± **Crop-wise Insights**: Recommendations vary based on crop type and soil health, enabling customized treatment.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn
- **Model**: Trained on open-source soil data for nutrient prediction
- **Deployment**: Localhost / Flask-based server

## üß™ How It Works

1. Users input soil features like pH, temperature, humidity, rainfall, etc.
2. The backend ML model processes this data to predict the optimal N, P, K values.
3. The application displays the recommended nutrient levels for balanced crop growth.
